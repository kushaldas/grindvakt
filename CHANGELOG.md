# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Hardened OpenID Federation resolve handling to validate the selected trust
  anchor's self-issued entity configuration, require resolve responses to be
  issued by the selected trust anchor, and require a returned trust chain that
  starts with the subject entity configuration and ends with the selected trust
  anchor.
- Added Entity Type key resolution helpers for OpenID Federation metadata,
  including `signed_jwks_uri` support and stricter handling of malformed inline
  `jwks` values so callers do not silently downgrade to weaker key retrieval.
- Tightened entity collection parsing to require explicit `entity_types`
  membership for `entity_type`-filtered results, matching the entity collection
  specification.
- Prevented released claims named `sub` from duplicating or overriding the
  canonical OpenID Connect subject in ID Tokens and UserInfo responses.
